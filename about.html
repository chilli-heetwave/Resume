        Hello, my name is Laura.<br>

        I began my cloud engineering apprenticeship 2 years ago. I was completely new to the field, as a matter of fact I barely knew what cloud engineering was.
        I was ready for a change and a new challenge which helped me get where I am now. During my apprenticeship I completed various courses and received an amazing opportunity
        to work on a Dynamics related project. I loved it and I decided to learn more which encouraged me to create this 'Resume Project'.

      When I don't work or learn I love to be outdoors. I enjoy being surrounded by nature which is why my favourite activities are built around that. Walking/hiking/paddleboarding is definitely
      one of my favourite things to do, I find it relaxing. <br>
      As well as that, I enjoy foods from different cultures and exploring new restaurants.<br>
